QBCore Items To OX Inventory Items

Hey guys! Back with some more usefull QBCore scripts!

This is a simple script from someone wanting to swap from qb-inventory - qs-inventory - ps inventory - or any inventory that uses QBCore items!

This script will save you time and not have to write out your hole items.lua again!

this script does NOT add exports so if one of your qbitems does not work with this make sure to read the documentation of the script if its not working with it might not be supported by ox inventory. if it is there should be a item for that one item then just replace it!

HOW TO USE

Download Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make a folder somewhere on you computer you can access

Open CMD

do cd UR DIRECTORY 
ex: cd C:/Customscript/QBCore

Then do python then the name of the script that you have saved it as
ex: python items.py

Boom then its straight forward from there!

Any issues DM Me on discord! Solo_capestick Thanks!
